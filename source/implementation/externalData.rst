External Data
*************

Metarelate Mapping-Manager manages relationships between various data sets held by the MetOcean-mapping project.
These data sets that are currently held locally are STASH, Field Code and CF Standard Name.

The goal of Metarelate is to not use local copies but access the data directly from
the authorised website or SPARQL endpoint in each case.

When querying remote data, Jena needs to know about any web proxies operating on your network
in order to navigate them correctly and reach the external data source so Java must be configured
correctly to handle this.

CF Standard Name
================

The original XML file is hosted at `CF Standard Name <http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/standard-name-table/19/cf-standard-name-table.xml>`_.
A local copy of this file is XSL transformed into RDF thence into Turtle and stored in the file 'default/cf-standard-name-table.ttl'.
